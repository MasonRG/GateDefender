# Gate Defenders
<i>A simple tower defense game featuring waves of enemies, three tower types, and three tower upgrade levels.</i>

This project is made using Unity 5.5.1f1 for the CSC 205: 2D Computer Graphics and Image Processing course at the University of Victoria. The project was made with a group of three, with myself having assistance with some art assets from other students in the course (contributions given below).

## Features

- Waves of enemies of increasing difficulty; each enemy type is vulnerable to a particular tower type and resistant to another
- Three tower types: gun, laser, and rocket. Each type has three tiers of upgrades, each upgrade having its own model and effects
- Tower behavior differences: gun towers have high rate of fire but low range and damage; laser towers have slow rate of fire but hit enemies behind their target; rocket towers have moderate rate of fire and do area-of-effect damage
- Unique models for towers, sound effects, and stylized visual effects
- Currency for buying, upgrading, and selling towers; with intuitive UI for placing and upgrading towers
- Three level layouts: easy, moderate, and hard
